Siege! The card game that's sweeping the Bootcamp!

Concept
-asymmetrical game of strategy
-deckbuilding game

Player Objective

Invader
To force the sieged city's surrender 
through either starvation of the citizens (when they overthrow the king)
successfully breaching the walls and sack the city.


Defender
Break the siege
Defeating the attacker in a pitched battle
Maintaining adequate food supply to keep citizens happy
Repel the invasion at the wall and cripple the invader's force.

Resources
No currency planned at this point.
Cards will generate food supply and upgrade opportunities. 
Invader
Must keep troop morale high to increase success chance of tactics (this is hidden from defender except in certain situations
Must maintain supply line to feed troops (is susceptible to night time raids from castle scouts
Defender
Must keep food reserves in place to feed citizens
Citizen morale is generally drained over time if unfolding events do not give them hope of success (this is hidden from invader unless spy missions are carried out successfully, or maybe other events)

Other factors
Siege weapons can be build by attackers but only one at a time over multiple turns (siege towers, battering rams, trebuchets)
Walls and siege defenses can be reinforced with upgrades or soldiers but soldiers grow lazy if constantly on alert.
Walls carry a static defending bonus unless lowered from trebuchets or battering ram


Card properties
v .1:
Card Types and principles
Each card will have a Siege Value, and building a deck will have to meet certain requirements. Decks will have maximum siege value, and total Siege Value must be <= max deck points

Monarch:
Food -> citizen morale
+ military readiness -> - citizen morale
+ siege defenses -> - military readiness
Hot Tar
Crow's feet
Wolf pits
+ troop garrisons -> - military defenses
+ sabotage -> - food -> disrupt supply lines (lowers invader morale)
Archers -

Invader:
Attack success -> troop morale
Constructing siege engines -> - troop morale
Trebuchets -> lower wall defenses, but also lowers troop morale
Cannot fire while invasion is underway
Defending Supply line -> lowers military strenght/morale (maybe)
Other TBD


Gameplay
Monarch chooses king and castle
King adds a special bonus
Allies abroad to assist
Bonus food production
More efficient troop readiness
Better espionage
Castle has a bonus and a weakness
A castle on a hill is harder to invade, but will starve sooner
A castle on the plains is easier to attack, but has better food provision
A large castle is tougher to breach, but takes more men to staff
A small castle is easy to feed, but easily taken if not using active defenses


Invader chooses Commander
Commanders will have unique bonuses/abilities
Celebrity - chance citizens overthrow Monarch
Siege Master - builds/moves siege equipment faster
Inspiration - bonus troop morale

Board State
Castle has between 3-5 sides and each holds a place on the board. The center most side is also the gate (marked with a piece). If there are four sides, then monarch's choice on which center stack is gate.
Monarch places initial traps/defenses/secret tunnels, face down, at Range 1
Invader cannot reach these without moving in firing range of castle
Other defenses/garrisons must be played face down on top of walls
Invaders are to be considered four units from the castle. Castle defenses can only reach three units from the castle
Range 4 - Invaders cannot be reached (unless Monarch can construct trebuchets). Trebuchets from invaders can reach the castle walls
Range 3 - Invaders can be reached by longbowmen and mangonels, but damage is mitigated
Range 2 - Invaders can be reached by longbowmen and mangonels and receive full damage
Range 1 - Invaders can only be reached by crossbows and traps set at start of game
Wall - Soldiers on the wall have swords and/or crossbows


Misc.
Traps
Moats (good against siege engines, cannot conduct espionage)
Murder holes
Food Supply is partially hidden from the invader.
0-X is hidden in granary.
